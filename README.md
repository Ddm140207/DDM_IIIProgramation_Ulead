# LEAD University Coding Practices 📝💻

## Welcome to my repository!
Here I upload my weekly coding exercises and practices from university.
This repo serves both as a personal study log and as a resource for anyone interested in reviewing programming fundamentals and problem-solving approaches.

## 📂 Structure

Each week has its own folder, containing the exercises and solutions:
### 📁 Week_01/
   └── practica_1.zip
### 📁 Week_02/
   └── practica_2.zip

Keep track of my progress over the quadrimester.

Share solutions with classmates and anyone learning to code.
